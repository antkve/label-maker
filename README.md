# label-maker
## a server-based utility for labelling landmarks on image training data
Running store.py starts a local flask server which you can connect to with any local device, which lets you upload and/or label training data for use in training intelligent landmarking agents.

The server may also be port-forwarded to allow public access, e.g. to allow remote employees to upload and label training data for you.
